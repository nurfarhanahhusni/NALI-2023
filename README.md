# Reflection üìù
## What I had gain from the NALI event ‚ú®:
As a student, the NALI 2023 program exposed me to a wide range of projects and topics, providing me with a great learning experience. The posters addressed a variety of subjects, including the use of ChatGPT to create Multiple-Choice Questions (MCQs), the application of Bandura's Social Learning Theory through a Facebook live project, the advantages and difficulties of puzzle games in ICT teaching, and the application of the CAP framework in a course that uses mobile robots for active learning. Every poster included insightful information, highlighting real-world uses and difficulties at the nexus of technology and education. All things considered, the course increased my grasp of creative methods for learning and addressing problems.
