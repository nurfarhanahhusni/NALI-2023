# Reflection üìù
## What I had gain from the NALI event ‚ú®:
As a student, the NALI 2023 program exposed me to a wide range of projects and topics, providing me with a great learning experience. The posters addressed a variety of subjects, including the use of ChatGPT to create Multiple-Choice Questions (MCQs), the application of Bandura's Social Learning Theory through a Facebook live project, the advantages and difficulties of puzzle games in ICT teaching, and the application of the CAP framework in a course that uses mobile robots for active learning. Every poster included insightful information, highlighting real-world uses and difficulties at the connection of technology and education. All things considered, the course increased my grasp of creative methods for learning and addressing problems.

## Improvement üí™:
As a suggestion, we can make learning last longer by providing extra resources. After the program, we can get access to recordings of the sessions, interesting articles, and a space where we can keep discussing and learning. This way, we can go back to what we learned during the program whenever we want. It's like having a library of knowledge that's always open for us.

By giving us more ways to learn, NALI 2023 can be a place where we not only get ready for the future but also become lifelong learners. It's all about staying curious and being prepared for whatever comes our way in the world of ICT.

## Others ‚ú®:
The wider value of education in students' lives is brought to light by the educational impact of programs such as NALI. This self-examination turns into a creative catalyst that inspires students to look into ways they may support educational projects or use their abilities to make a difference in the education industry. NALI provides a springboard for innovative thinking about the wider transformative potential of education.
